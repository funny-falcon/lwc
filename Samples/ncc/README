This is the ncc source code analyser from 

	http://freshmeat.net/projects/ncc

quickly ported to lwc. The original is in C++.

It works. The speed is *exactly* the same as the C++ version
and the executable is bigger (?).  Is it the long names?
It is smaller if both are stripped.

Except from the speed/size comparisons this can
be an ultimate test case for many things.


At least now ncc can analyse itself. See code.map
