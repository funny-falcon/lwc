This is a real-time raytracer. I wanted to write a game, but it seems
that something is broken somewhere. Anyway, it is fun so far.

The compilation assumes you have athlon-xp with sse.
If you have another processor EDIT THE MAKEFILE!
If you know you have sse, leave the -mfpmath=sse flag!

NOTE that the program runs on 16-bit-per-pixel color displays
If you have anything else, I don't know what will happen!
You'll probably see junk.

Once you're done, get into X windows and run a.out

In the first screen you are able to move the character in a room
with a light bulb. With 'p' and 'l' you move forward and backward.
With 'k' ans 'm' up and down. With ',' and '.' you rotate.
With 'q' you exit into the demos.

The demos go on to count frames per second.

The very interesting thing demonstrated here (except raytracing,
which BTW if you like the idea contact me), is how to write a
portable lwc program. The game uses Xlib functions. These
are wrapped in grfix.c, the lwc file main.c+ does not include
any system headers.

Also, the program tries to achieve speed by extreme inlining
and compile-time polymorphism and template interfaces.
(must use abstract classes in the next version)
