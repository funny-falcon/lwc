The object oriented lwc all-purpose utility library
---------------------------------------------------


Who needs STL?

Seriously though, this is a very object oriented library
providing dbstrees, inttrees, load_file and an expanding
array template.

the testlib does not really test much.

This is rather a very good test case for lwc program itself.
